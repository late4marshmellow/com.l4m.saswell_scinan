Saswell and Scinan Controllers
Support wifi climate controllers using the Scinan or Saswell API

Supported Devices
Any device using either the Smart-E (API v1) or Thermostat (API v2) app by Saswell should be able to connect. 
These are the ones reported working. There are probably more devices supported. Open a issue and I'll try to find out.
