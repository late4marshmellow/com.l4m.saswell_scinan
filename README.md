# Scinan Reborn
Since the original app by Petter Ruud seems to be abandoned and i was in need for this app to work, i have tried to to my best without any coding knowledge to make this happend. 

Learing curve is steep but i had made some progress.

What is fixed and what is left to figure out.

# Fixed
-Corrected the "forEach is not a function" during pairing
-Fixed so token again will be obtained from scinan.


# Scinan
Support wifi climate controllers using the Scinan API https://api.scinan.com.

## Supported Devices
It seems that this app will work with any device that make use of the Scinan Api and/or the Smart-E app on Iphone/Android

it is confirmed by Petter Ruud that it works with the two listed below and i can confirm this indeed works with the new Pergo Quick Heat NEQHKITWIFI that looks similar to the Prosmart PST50W

There are probably more devices supported. Open a issue and I'll try to find out.


#### Saswell
 - SAS920FHL-7W-WIFI

#### Prosmart
 - PST50W

#### Pergo QuickHeat
 - The new one sold in Coop OBS Bygg (Norway)
